Dgraph Cloud is compatible with the majority of Dgraph features, so you can easily
migrate your existing Dgraph-powered app over to Dgraph Cloud.

### To migrate data from self-managed Dgraph to Dgraph Cloud

1. Create a new backend. You can do this using the Dgraph Cloud interface.
2. (optional) Switch your backend to [flexible mode](/docs/cloud/admin/schema-modes#flexible-mode).
3. Connect to your backend with your favorite client. To learn more, see [Connecting from Dgraph Clients](/docs/cloud/advanced-queries#connecting-from-dgraph-clients).
