Dgraph Query Language (DQL) can be used to extend GraphQL API capabilities when writing:

- custom DQL resolvers
- subscriptions on DQL queries



When writing custom DQL query resolvers, you must understand the GraphQL - DQL schema mapping to use proper aliases inside DQL queries to map them to the GraphQL response.
