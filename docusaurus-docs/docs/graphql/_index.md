Dgraph lets you generate a GraphQL API and a graph backend from a single GraphQL schema, no resolvers or custom queries are needed. Dgraph automatically generates the GraphQL operations for queries and mutations 

GraphQL developers can get started in minutes, and need not concern themselves with the powerful graph database running in the background.

Dgraph extends the [GraphQL specifications](https://spec.graphql.org/) with directives and allows you to customize the behavior of GraphQL operations using custom resolvers or to write you own resolver logic with Lambda resolvers.

Dgraph also supports 
- GraphQL subscriptions with the `@withSubscription` directive: a client application can execute a subscription query and receive real-time updates when the subscription query result is updated.
- [Apollo federation](/docs/federation/index) : you can create a gateway GraphQL service that includes the Dgraph GraphQL API and other GraphQL services.
