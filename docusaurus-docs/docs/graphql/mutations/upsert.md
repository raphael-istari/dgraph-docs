Upsert mutations allow you to perform `add` or `update` operations based on whether a particular `ID` exists in the database. The IDs must be external IDs, defined using the `@id` directive in the schema.

For example, to demonstrate how upserts work in GraphQL, take the following schema:

**Schema**
```graphql
type Author 
}

type Post 
}
```

Dgraph automatically generates input and return types in the schema for the `add` mutation, as shown below:

```graphql
addPost(input: [AddPostInput!]!, upsert: Boolean): AddPostPayload

input AddPostInput 
}
```

Suppose you want to update the `text` field of a post with the ID `mm2`. But you also want to create a new post with that ID in case it doesn't already exist. To do this, you use the `addPost` mutation, but with an additional input variable `upsert`.  

This is a `Boolean` variable. Setting it to `true` will result in an upsert operation.

It will perform an `update` mutation and carry out the changes you specify in your request if the particular ID exists. Otherwise, it will fall back to a default `add` operation and create a new `Post` with that ID and the details you provide.

Setting `upsert` to `false` is the same as using a plain `add` operationâ€”it'll either fail or succeed, depending on whether the ID exists or not.

**Example**: Add mutation with `upsert` true:

```graphql
mutation($post: [AddPostInput!]!) 
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With variables:

```json

		}
	}
}
```

If a post with the ID `mm2` exists, it will update the post with the new details. Otherwise, it'll create a new `Post` with that ID and the values you provided. In either case, you'll get the following response back:

```graphql
"data": 
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```


* The default value of `upsert` will be `false`, for backward compatibility.
* The current behavior of `Add` and `Update` mutations is such that they do not update deep level nodes. So Add mutations with `upsert` set to `true` will only update values at the root level.
