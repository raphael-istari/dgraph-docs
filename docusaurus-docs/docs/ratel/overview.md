Ratel is a tool for data visualization and cluster management that's designed
from the ground-up to work with Dgraph and [DQL](/docs//query-language). You can use it for the following types of tasks:

* Connect to a backend and manage cluster settings (see [Connection](/docs//ratel/connection))
* Run DQL queries and mutations, and see results (see [Console](/docs//ratel/console))
* Update or replace your DQL schema, and drop data (see [Schema](/docs//ratel/schema))
* Get information on cluster nodes and remove nodes (see [Cluster](/docs//ratel/cluster))
* Backup your server if you are using self-managed Dgraph (see [Backup](/docs//ratel/backups))

To get started with Ratel, use it online with the [Dgraph Ratel Dashboard](https://play.dgraph.io) or clone and build Ratel using the [instructions
from the Ratel repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ratel/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
